\واژه{iot-acr} is spreading it's reach and addressable lighting systems can with this technology give users the ability to create interesting scenes with a low cost and hight accessibility, without the need for complex technical knowledge. This combination requires a web broweser, a controller, a set of DC motors and a power supply which the procedure of it's making is documented in this text. In order to make a connection between the user which runs a web or native application and the controller which is equipped with Wi-Fi peripherals to connect to the IP network, \واژه{iot-acr} is used for trasmitting information through the local network or the Internet. The controller is directly connected to the motor controller via it's specialized protocol and the power supply respondes the power demand of these two.
