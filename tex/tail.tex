\واژه{iot-acr} is spreading it's reach and addressable lighting systems can with this technology give users the ability to create interesting scenes with a low cost and hight accessibility, without the need for complex technical knowledge. This combination requires a web broweser, a controller, a light strip and a power supply which the procedure of it's making is documented in this text. In order to make a connection between the user which runs a web or native application and the controller which is equipped with Wi-Fi peripherals to connect to the IP network, \واژه{iot-acr} is used for trasmitting information through the local network or the Internet. The controller is directly connected to the light strip via it's specialized protocol and the power supply respondes the power demand of these two. With an secondary software it's possible use an arbitrary source of audio to create harmonic light shows by this system, sychronized with the music.
